# Hi!
I'm Konstantin, an incoming CS freshman at UCLA! I like coding, math and 3D modeling! If you want to learn more about me, check out my [personal website](http://tzantchev.com) (still under construction, so it might not yet be active when you're reading this!).

# ðŸ–¥ Projects
I work on various types of projects, ranging from web apps to image manipulation tools. On this GitHub, you'll find all of the repositories for my open-source projects. This is a list of some of the most interesting ones (I still encourage you to check the others out if you're interested):
 - [Sorting algorithm visualizer](https://github.com/konstantintzt/sorting-algorithms)
 - [Image Editor](https://github.com/konstantintzt/Image-Editor)
 - [GIF Captioner](https://github.com/konstantintzt/gif-caption)

## â„¹ Channel infos
If you're interested in programming, tech and science, check out [my YouTube channel _Broksy_](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKfHdzN4z0aLeee51Lvm2Tw). You'll find more detailed video explanations for some of my projects. These range from 3D modeling and simulations to visualizations of sorting algorithms. For most of them the source code is (or will be) available on GitHub. If you end up enjoying my content, don't hesitate to subscribe, like and share!
