 - [Sorting algorithm visualizer](https://github.com/konstantintzt/sorting-algorithms)

If you're interested in programming, tech and science, check out [my YouTube channel _Broksy_](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKfHdzN4z0aLeee51Lvm2Tw). There, I present some of the projects that I do. They range from 3D modeling and simulations to visualizations of sorting algorithms. For most if not all of them, the source code is available on my GitHub. If you end up enjoying my content, don't hesitate to subscribe, like and share!
